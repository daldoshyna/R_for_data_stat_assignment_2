For this assignment I chose to continue working on the **dataset about income inequality** (income_inequality_processed.csv), and take a closer look at the **countries of G7** (without France, because, unfortunately, it's not in the dataset).

```{r}
#| label: Import the Data
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| cache: false

income_inequality <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-08-05/income_inequality_processed.csv')
```

Basic information about the columns of the dataset:

```{r}
#| label: Explore the Data
#| include: true
#| cache: false

income_inequality |> 
  head(10) |> 
  gt()
```

### Chronological tendecies
Firstly, let's take a look at how Index Gini "post-tax" changed in the countries of G7 throughout the years:


```{r}
#| label: Chronological tendecies
#| include: true
#| cache: false

# cleaning data
countries_G7 <- c("Germany", "Japan", "Canada", "France", "Italy", "United Kingdom", "United States")

income_inequality <- income_inequality |> 
  filter(!is.na(gini_mi_eq),
         Entity %in% countries_G7,
         (Year >= 2010) & (Year <= 2020)) |> 
  mutate(Year_date = as.Date(paste0(Year, "-01-01")),
         gini_diff = gini_mi_eq - gini_dhi_eq)

fig <- income_inequality |> 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = Year_date, 
    y = gini_dhi_eq, 
    color = Entity)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Index Gini 'post-tax'",
       title = "Changes of Index Gini 'post-tax' in the countries of G7 throughout the years") +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year", date_labels = "%Y") +
  theme_light()

ggplotly(data = fig)
```

<br>

### Relation between Gini Index 'pre-tax' and 'post-tax' 
Secondly, let's take a look at how Indexes Gini 'pre-tax' and 'post-tax' are related to each other in the countries of G7:


```{r}
#| label: Relation between Gini Index 'pre-tax' and 'post-tax' 
#| include: true
#| cache: false


fig <- income_inequality |> 
  ggplot( aes(x = gini_mi_eq, y = gini_dhi_eq, color = Entity)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
    labs(x = "Gini 'pre-tax'", y = "Gini 'post-tax'")

ggplotly(data = fig)
```
We can see that the data about the countries is located in quite distinct clusters.

### Difference between Gini Index 'pre-tax' and 'post-tax'
Thirdly, let's look at the difference between Gini Index 'pre-tax' and 'post-tax' in the countries of G7. It shows how much redistribution (taxes, social benefits) reduces inequality.

```{r}
#| label: Difference between Gini Index
#| include: true
#| cache: false

income_inequality |> 
   filter(Year == 2020) |> 
  
  ggplot(aes(
    x = as.factor(Entity), 
    y = gini_diff,
    fill = Entity            
  )) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = gini_diff), 
            vjust = -0.3,
            size = 3.5) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Country",
       y = "The difference",
       title = "Difference between Gini Index 'pre-tax' and 'post-tax' in 2020")

```
